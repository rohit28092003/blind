				You have C=100,000 cakes, numbered 1 through C. Each cake has an integer height; initially, the height of each cake is 0. There are N operations. In each operation, you are given two integers L and R, and you should increase by 1 the height of each of the cakes L,L+1,…,R. One of these N operations should be removed and the remaining N−1 operations are then performed. Chef wants to remove one operation in such a way that after the remaining N−1 operations are performed, the number of cakes with height exactly K is maximum possible. Since Chef is a bit busy these days, he has asked for your help. You need to find the maximum number of cakes with height exactly K that can be achieved by removing one operation.
